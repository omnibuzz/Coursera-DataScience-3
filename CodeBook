The dataset that is provided by the run_analysis.R file has the following features:
It's a flat file generated by run_analysis.R and has 180 obs. of  69 variables:
The 180 observations are for 30 different subjects (Varible 1) and each subject performing 6 activities (denoted by variable 2 and 3, 2 holding the activity code ( 1 to 6) and 3 holding the name - WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING )
The rest of the variables provides the mean of the observations. There is one set of observations per Subject activity combination.

The variables in the dataset are as follows:
SubjectId                           int  								
Identifier of the subject. Can be between 1 and 30

ActivityCode                        int  								
Code to identify the activity can be 1 to 6.

ActivityName                        Factor w/ 6 levels				 	
It corresponds to an activity name WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS,WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

All the below variables are calculating the average of the measure for a particular subject and activity. They are all decimal values 
between -1 and 1. The variable name signify what they measure. It follows the following pattern:

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

mean - Indicates it was the mean of the signal
std - Indicates it was the standard deviation of the signal.
